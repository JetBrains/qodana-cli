A command-line helper for Qodana pricing[1] to calculate active contributor(s)[2] in the given local repositories.

[1] This pricing is preliminary and subject to change.
Early adopters may receive special offers, which we 
will announce prior to the commercial release.

[2] An active contributor is anyone who has made a commit to any 
of the projects youâ€™ve registered in Qodana Cloud within the last 90 days, 
regardless of when those commits were originally authored. The number of such 
contributors will be calculated using both the commit author information 
and the timestamp for when their contribution to the project was pushed.

[3] Ultimate Plus plan currently has a discount, more information can be found on %s
