# Qodana CLI

> ðŸ’¡ **Note**: This is experimental project, so it's not guaranteed to work correctly.
> Use it at your own risk. For running Qodana stably and reliably, please use [Qodana Docker Images](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/qodana/docker-images.html).

`qodana` is a command line interface for [Qodana](https://jetbrains.com/qodana). 
It allows you to run Qodana inspections on your local machine (or a CI agent) easily, by running [Qodana Docker Images](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/qodana/docker-images.html).

## Prerequisites

The Qodana CLI is distributed and run as a binary. The actual linters with inspections are Docker Images. 
To support this, you must have Docker installed and running locally.

## Installation

We have installation scripts for Linux, macOS and Windows. Alternatively, you can install the latest binary from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/tiulpin/qodana/releases/latest).

### Linux and macOS

Install and run `qodana` to `/urs/local/bin`:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tiulpin/qodana/main/install | bash
```

If you want to install some specific version, add the version number (e.g. `0.2.0`) **in the end** of the command.

### Windows

Install and run `qodana` to `$Home\bin`:

```shell
iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tiulpin/qodana/main/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```

If you want to install some specific version, add the version number (e.g. `$v="0.2.0";`) **in the beginning** of the command.

## Usage

### Project configuration

Before you start using Qodana, you need to configure your project. 
Qodana CLI can do that for you, just run the following command in your project root:

```sh
qodana init
```

### Project analysis

Right after you configured your project, you can run Qodana inspections simply by invoking the following command in your project root:

```sh
qodana scan
```

- After the first Qodana run, the following runs will be faster because of the saved Qodana cache in your project (defaults to `./.qodana/cache`)
- Latest Qodana report will be saved to `./.qodana/results` â€“ you can find qodana.sarif.json and other Qodana artifacts (like logs) in this directory.

### Show report

After analysis is done, the results are saved to `./.qodana/results` by default. Inside the directory `./.qodana/results/report`, you can find Qodana HTML report.
To view it in the browser, run the following command from your project root:

```shell
qodana show
```

You can serve any Qodana HTML report regardless of the project, if you provide the correct report path.

### More configuration

To find more CLI options, run `qodana ...` commands with the `--help` flag. Currently there are not many options, if you want to configure Qodana or checks inside Qodana, consider using [`qodana.yaml` ](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/qodana/qodana-yaml.html).
