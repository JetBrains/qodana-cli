`qodana` is a simple cross-platform command-line tool to run [Qodana linters](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/qodana/docker-images.html) anywhere with minimum effort required.

#### tl;dr

[Install](https://github.com/JetBrains/qodana-cli/releases/latest) and run:

```console
qodana scan --show-report
```

You can also add the linter by its name with the `--linter` option (e.g. `--linter jetbrains/qodana-js`).

## Usage

### Installation

See [the repository releases](https://github.com/JetBrains/qodana-cli/releases/latest) for the detailed instructions on the installation and update.


### Prepare your project

Before you start using Qodana, you need to configure your project â€“ choose [a linter](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/qodana/linters.html) to use.
If you know what linter you want to use, you can skip this step.

Also, Qodana CLI can choose a linter for you. Just run the following command in your **project root**:

```console
qodana init
```

### Analyze your project

Right after you configured your project (or remember linter's name you want to run),
you can run Qodana inspections simply by invoking the following command in your project root:

```console
qodana scan
```

- After the first Qodana run, the following runs will be faster because of the saved Qodana cache in your project (defaults to `./<userCacheDir>/JetBrains/<linter>/cache`)
- The latest Qodana report will be saved to `./<userCacheDir>/JetBrains/<linter>/results` â€“ you can find qodana.sarif.json and other Qodana artifacts (like logs) in this directory.

### View the report

After the analysis, the results are saved to `./<userCacheDir>/JetBrains/<linter>/results` by default.
Inside the directory `./<userCacheDir>/JetBrains/<linter>/results/report`, you can find a Qodana HTML report.
To view it in the browser, run the following command from your project root:

```console
qodana show
```

You can serve any Qodana HTML report regardless of the project if you provide the correct report path.

## Configuration

To find more CLI options run `qodana ...` commands with the `--help` flag.
If you want to configure Qodana or a check inside Qodana,
consider
using [`qodana.yaml` ](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/qodana/qodana-yaml.html) to have the same configuration on any CI you use and your machine.

> In some flags help texts you can notice that the default path contains `<userCacheDir>/JetBrains`. The `<userCacheDir>` differs from the OS you are running Qodana with.
> - macOS: `~/Library/Caches/`
> - Linux: `~/.cache/`
> - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\`

### init

Configure a project for Qodana

#### Synopsis

Configure a project for Qodana:
prepare Qodana configuration file by analyzing the project structure
and generating a default configuration qodana.yaml file.

```
init [flags]
```

#### Options

```
  -h, --help                 help for init
  -i, --project-dir string   Root directory of the project to configure (default ".")
```

### scan

Scan project with Qodana

#### Synopsis

Scan a project with Qodana.
It runs one of Qodana Docker's images
(https://www.jetbrains.com/help/qodana/docker-images.html) and reports the results.

Note that most options can be configured via qodana.yaml (https://www.jetbrains.com/help/qodana/qodana-yaml.html) file.
But you can always override qodana.yaml options with the following command-line options.


```
scan [flags]
```

#### Options

```
  -a, --analysis-id string        Unique report identifier (GUID) to be used by Qodana Cloud
  -b, --baseline string           Provide the path to an existing SARIF report to be used in the baseline state calculation
      --baseline-include-absent   Include in the output report the results from the baseline run that are absent in the current run
      --cache-dir string          Override cache directory (default <userCacheDir>/JetBrains/<linter>/cache)
  -c, --changes                   Override the docker image to be used for the analysis
      --clear-cache               Clear the local Qodana cache before running the analysis
      --disable-sanity            Skip running the inspections configured by the sanity profile
  -e, --env stringArray           Define additional environment variables for the Qodana container (you can use the flag multiple times). CLI is not reading full host environment variables and does not pass it to the Qodana container for security reasons
      --fail-threshold string     Set the number of problems that will serve as a quality gate. If this number is reached, the inspection run is terminated with a non-zero exit code
  -h, --help                      help for scan
  -l, --linter string             Override linter to use
      --port int                  Port to serve the report on (default 8080)
      --print-problems            Print all found problems by Qodana in the CLI output
  -n, --profile-name string       Profile name defined in the project
  -p, --profile-path string       Path to the profile file
  -i, --project-dir string        Root directory of the inspected project (default ".")
      --property stringArray      Set a JVM property to be used while running Qodana using the --property property.name=value1,value2,...,valueN notation
  -o, --results-dir string        Override directory to save Qodana inspection results to (default <userCacheDir>/JetBrains/<linter>/results)
      --run-promo string          Set to 'true' to have the application run the inspections configured by the promo profile; set to 'false' otherwise (default: 'true' only if Qodana is executed with the default profile)
  -s, --save-report               Generate HTML report (default true)
      --script string             Override the run scenario (default "default")
      --send-report               Send the inspection report to Qodana Cloud, requires the '--token' option to be specified
  -w, --show-report               Serve HTML report on port
      --skip-pull                 Skip pulling the latest Qodana container
  -d, --source-directory string   Directory inside the project-dir directory must be inspected. If not specified, the whole project is inspected
      --stub-profile string       Absolute path to the fallback profile file. This option is applied in case the profile was not specified using any available options

```

### show

Show a Qodana report

#### Synopsis

Show (serve) the latest Qodana report.

Due to JavaScript security restrictions, the generated report cannot
be viewed via the file:// protocol (by double-clicking the index.html file).  
https://www.jetbrains.com/help/qodana/html-report.html 
This command serves the Qodana report locally and opens a browser to it.

```
show [flags]
```

#### Options

```
  -d, --dir-only             Open report directory only, don't serve it
  -h, --help                 help for show
  -p, --port int             Specify port to serve report at (default 8080)

## Why

Qodana linters are distributed via Docker images â€“
which become handy for developers (us) and users to run code inspections in CI.

But to set up Qodana in CI, one wants to try it locally first,
as there is some additional configuration tuning required that differs from project to project
(and we try to be as much user-friendly as possible).

It's easy to try Qodana locally by running a _simple_ command:

```console
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 -v <source-directory>/:/data/project/ -v <output-directory>/:/data/results/ -v <caches-directory>/:/data/cache/ jetbrains/qodana-<linter> --show-report
```

**And that's not so simple**: you have to provide a few absolute paths, forward some ports, add a few Docker options...

- On Linux, you might want to set the proper permissions to the results produced after the container run â€“ so you need to add an option like `-u $(id -u):$(id -g)`
- On Windows and macOS, when there is the default Docker Desktop RAM limit (2GB), your run might fail because of OOM (and this often happens on big Gradle projects on Gradle sync), and the only workaround, for now, is increasing the memory â€“ but to find that out, one needs to look that up in the docs.
- That list could go on, but we've thought about these problems, experimented a bit, and created the CLI to simplify all of this.

**Isn't that a bit overhead to write a tool that runs Docker containers when we have Docker CLI already?** Our CLI, like Docker CLI, operates with Docker daemon via Docker Engine API using the official Docker SDK, so actually, our tool is our own tailored Docker CLI at the moment.
