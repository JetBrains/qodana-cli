`qodana` is a simple cross-platform command-line tool to run [Qodana linters](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/qodana/docker-images.html) anywhere with minimum effort required.

#### tl;dr

[Install](https://github.com/JetBrains/qodana-cli/releases/latest) and run:

```console
qodana scan --show-report
```

You can also add the linter by its name with the `--linter` option (e.g. `--linter jetbrains/qodana-js`).

## Installation

> ðŸ’¡ The Qodana CLI is distributed and run as a binary. The Qodana linters with inspections are [Docker Images](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/qodana/docker-images.html) or, starting from version `2023.2`, your local/downloaded by CLI IDE installations (experimental support).
> - To run Qodana with a container (the default mode in CLI), you must have Docker or Podman installed and running locally to support this: https://www.docker.com/get-started, and, if you are using Linux, you should be able to run Docker from the current (non-root) user (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user)
> - To run Qodana without a container, you must have the IDE installed locally to provide the IDE installation path to the CLI or specify the product code, and CLI will try to download the IDE automatically (experimental support).

#### macOS and Linux
##### Install with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (recommended)
```shell
brew install jetbrains/utils/qodana
```
##### Install with our installer
```shell
curl -fsSL https://jb.gg/qodana-cli/install | bash
```
Also, you can install `nightly` or any other version the following way:
```
curl -fsSL https://jb.gg/qodana-cli/install | bash -s -- nightly
```

#### Windows
##### Install with [Windows Package Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/) (recommended)
```shell
winget install -e --id JetBrains.QodanaCLI
```
##### Install with [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org)
```shell
choco install qodana
```
##### Install with [Scoop](https://scoop.sh)
```shell
scoop bucket add jetbrains https://github.com/JetBrains/scoop-utils
scoop install qodana
```

#### Anywhere else
Alternatively,
you can install the latest binary (or the apt/rpm/deb package)
from [this page](https://github.com/JetBrains/qodana-cli/releases/latest).

## Usage

ðŸŽ¥ The "Get Started with Qodana CLI" video is [also available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV1MFnURMP8).

### Prepare your project

Before you start using Qodana, you need to configure your project â€“
choose [a linter](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/qodana/linters.html) to use.
If you know what linter you want to use, you can skip this step.

Also, Qodana CLI can choose a linter for you. Just run the following command in your **project root**:

```shell
qodana init
```

### Analyze your project

Right after you configured your project (or remember linter's name you want to run),
you can run Qodana inspections simply by invoking the following command in your project root:

```shell
qodana scan
```

- After the first Qodana run, the following runs will be faster because of the saved Qodana cache in your project (defaults to `./<userCacheDir>/JetBrains/<linter>/cache`)
- The latest Qodana report will be saved to `./<userCacheDir>/JetBrains/<linter>/results` â€“ you can find qodana.sarif.json and other Qodana artifacts (like logs) in this directory.

### View the report

After the analysis, the results are saved to `./<userCacheDir>/JetBrains/<linter>/results` by default.
Inside the directory `./<userCacheDir>/JetBrains/<linter>/results/report`, you can find a Qodana HTML report.
To view it in the browser, run the following command from your project root:

```shell
qodana show
```

You can serve any Qodana HTML report regardless of the project if you provide the correct report path.

## Configuration

To find more CLI options run `qodana ...` commands with the `--help` flag.
If you want to configure Qodana or a check inside Qodana,
consider
using [`qodana.yaml` ](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/qodana/qodana-yaml.html) to have the same configuration on any CI you use and your machine.

> In some flags help texts you can notice that the default path contains `<userCacheDir>/JetBrains`. The `<userCacheDir>` differs from the OS you are running Qodana with.
> - macOS: `~/Library/Caches/`
> - Linux: `~/.cache/`
> - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\`
> Also, you can just run `qodana show -d` to open the directory with the latest Qodana report.

### init

Configure a project for Qodana

#### Synopsis

Configure a project for Qodana:

  of the projects youâ€™ve registered in Qodana Cloud within the last 90 days,
  regardless of when those commits were originally authored. The number of such
  contributors will be calculated using both the commit author information
  and the timestamp for when their contribution to the project was pushed.

## Why

![Comics by Irina Khromova](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13538286/151377284-28d845d3-a601-4512-9029-18f99d215ee1.png)

> ðŸ–¼ [Irina Khromova painted the illustration](https://www.instagram.com/irkin_sketch/)

Qodana linters are distributed via Docker images â€“
which become handy for developers (us) and users to run code inspections in CI.

But to set up Qodana in CI, one wants to try it locally first,
as there is some additional configuration tuning required that differs from project to project
(and we try to be as much user-friendly as possible).

It's easy to try Qodana locally by running a _simple_ command:

```shell
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -v <source-directory>/:/data/project/ -v <output-directory>/:/data/results/ -v <caches-directory>/:/data/cache/ jetbrains/qodana-<linter> --show-report
```

**And that's not so simple**: you have to provide a few absolute paths, forward some ports, add a few Docker options...

- On Linux, you might want to set the proper permissions to the results produced after the container run â€“ so you need to add an option like `-u $(id -u):$(id -g)`
- On Windows and macOS, when there is the default Docker Desktop RAM limit (2GB), your run might fail because of OOM (and this often happens on big Gradle projects on Gradle sync), and the only workaround, for now, is increasing the memory â€“ but to find that out, one needs to look that up in the docs.
- That list could go on, but we've thought about these problems, experimented a bit, and created the CLI to simplify all of this.

**Isn't that a bit overhead to write a tool that runs Docker containers when we have Docker CLI already?** Our CLI, like Docker CLI, operates with Docker daemon via Docker Engine API using the official Docker SDK, so actually, our tool is our own tailored Docker CLI at the moment.
